=== 🤠 Howdy! === 

Raised on Java, pupil of Python, now a self taught web developer. The journey of learning never ends.

=== 🦉 What I know  ===

`JS / React / Node / Express / HTML / CSS / Java / SQL / NoSQL / MongoDB / Git`

=== 🐀 What I'm Learning ===

`Typescript / GraphQL / React Native / Firebase` 

=== 🦀 Who I am ===
Some might call me a professional dilettante. I'm a dabbler in acting, painting, music production, and board gaming. Guitar is my instrument of choice, but if I'm feeling crazy I'll pull out the banjo. If you ask me what book I'm reading, there's a ~50% chance it's terrible sci-fi.
