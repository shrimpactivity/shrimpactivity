## === 🦐 Howdy! === 
Raised on Java, now a self taught web developer. I like building whacky apps. 

## === 🦉 What I Know  ===
```
JavaScript + React + Redux + React Router + Jest 
Java + JUnit + Maven + Python + Node + Express 
SQL + MongoDB
Git + Bash + CI/CD + Github Actions
```

## === 🦀 Who I Am ===
- Some might call me a professional dabbler. I do a little acting, painting, music production, and board gaming. 
- Guitar is my instrument of choice. 
- If you ask me what book I'm reading, there's a 50/50 chance it's either an old classic or terrible sci-fi. 
- Let's play chess - you'll win after I throw out a dubious gambit.
